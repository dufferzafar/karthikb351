excerpt: >
  Built a rapid-response crowdsourced site in response to the floods in Chennai. It was used by thousands of people to crowdsource and coordinate places for shelter, food, aid and realtime updates from neighbourhoods in the city.

Along with a few others, [ChennaiRains.org](http://chennairains.org) was setup within a few hours of the floods starting, around 2am. It started with just a handful of people and grew to over 200 volunteers in 3 days. In addition to building the website and supporting tech, I helped setup the communications channels and tools to manage all the data and volunteers. It was a combination of Slack and Google Spreadsheets that powered the whole campaign, with some scripting to glue it all together.
