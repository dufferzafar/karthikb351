excerpt: >
  A service and app to help students at VIT University manage their academics. It was built with two friends from college and was my first exploration into product development. It is currently used by **over 20,000 students** at VIT University.

It is full fledged product for students to manage their academics. It was initially built with on Google App Engine(Python) but we quickly outgrew that, so we moved to Node.js + MongoDB hosted on Heroku. We also built native client apps for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karthikb351.vitinfo2&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/vitacademics/id727796987?mt=8) and [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/vitacademics-8-1/d6a9e028-4cc2-46ea-9f1b-84c02f4ae408). As well as a [Web App](https://vitacademics-web.herokuapp.com/) and even an [SMS interface](http://vitacademics-rel.herokuapp.com/api/txtweb).

All the applications were developed in parallel and backed by a single, versioned and [well documented](https://github.com/aneesh-neelam/VITacademics/wiki/JSON-API) REST API.
